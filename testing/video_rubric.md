# Video: Marking criteria

We will not grade your code directly. Instead, we will learn about your teamwork and addecho project through your video.

You will upload your video to Youtube and submit the URL of your video to MarkUs in a file called video.txt

You should upload ONLY your video URL to MarkUs, not your actual video. Your video itself has to be on Youtube.

Please test opening your video in a private browser window (incognito) to make sure we will have permission to open it. You may keep the video unlisted if you like.

The rubric below is for your reference. Your grade will be based on your overall work and not simply on the sum of your performance on the individual items in the rubric.

Your video is expected to be about 12 minutes, with an absolute maximum of 15 minutes. TAs will not listen/watch the video following 15 minutes.

When discussing or moving from one section of the rubric to another, please clearly state this in the video. For example, "Now we will do the code walkthrough..." Also, we would highly recommend segmenting the video according to chapters {https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9884579?hl=en} based on the sections provided in the rubric, but it is not mandatory. 


## Evaluation rubric

### Compiling Program

4pts -Video shows your team compiling your program with no errors or warnings

2pts -Video shows your team compiling your program but with errors or warnings

0pts -Video does not show compiling your program


### Running Program

10pts -The program executes flawlessly on supplied or typical test cases, meeting all specified requirements and producing correct output.

8pts -The program mostly executes correctly, with minor issues with the supplied or typical test cases, meeting most but not all of the specified requirements.

6pts -The program executes adequately on some supplied or typical test cases, meeting most but not all if the specified requirements. There are noticeable issues and errors in the output.

4pts -The program has numerous issues in execution on supplied or typical test cases, presenting significant issues, errors, and deviations from the specified requirements.

0pts -The program does not execute correctly on any of the supplied or typical test cases. There are critical errors all of the specified requirements.


### Code Walkthrough

20pts -Video provides a clear and concise overview of critical or interesting portions of the code and explains it's significance.

15pts -Video provides an overview of critical or interesting portions of the code. But there may be areas in the video where additional clarity or details could be added to the explanations.

10pts -Video provides a limited scope of critical or interesting portions of the code, and there are several instances of unclear explanations. Some explanations may lack important details, making it moderately challenging for the viewer to understand the significance of the code.

5pts -The video explanations struggle to provide a clear and concise overview of critical or interesting portions of the code. Several explanations are difficult to understand the code's significance.

0pts -The video does not contain a code walkthrough.


### Demonstrating Testing

15pts -Video shows examples of comprehensive testing, which includes edge cases in addition to the typical test cases that are holistically represent of the program's functionality. (We are expecting you to have created your own small test cases!)

10pts -Video shows good testing, which is mostly representative of the program's functionality. But the video is missing some important test cases; this includes limited or missing coverage of one to three essential typical cases, edge cases, etc.

5pts -Video shows adequate testing but is missing several (more than 3) test cases (i.e., typical cases, edge cases, etc.), demonstrating a basic understanding of the program's functionality. 

0pt -Video shows insufficient testing, missing almost all typical cases, edge cases, etc., demonstrating a limited understanding of the program's functionality.


### Issues Encountered / Alternatives Considered

6pts - Video clearly states 2 to 3 challenges or difficulties your team encountered during development, any alternative considerations, and how you overcame these challenges as a group.

4pts -Video briefly states 1 to 2 challenges or difficulties encountered during development and how they were addressed. Alternatives considered are presented, though there may be minor gaps in the explanation or detail.

2pts -Video attempts to discuss challenges encountered during development and how they were overcome, but is unclear or lacking in detail. Alternatives considered may be briefly mentioned but lack depth in analysis or explanation.

0pts -Video does not address challenges encountered during development. There is no mention of alternatives considered or the group's efforts in overcoming challenges.


### Teamwork in Coding the Assignment

10pts -Video briefly describes each of the group members' contributions. The contributions appear well-coordinated, and there is evidence of effective team discussion and planning.

5pts -Video briefly describes each of the group members' contributions. However, contribution and communication appear to have some challenges, with noticeable issues in clarity or coordination affecting team dynamics.

0pts - Video describes team communication to be limited or unclear, leading to challenges in coordination.


### Teamwork in Presenting the Video

10pts -All group members have actively contributed to the creation of the video, demonstrating a collaborative effort. This includes each member of the group presenting in the video.

5pts -Only some group members have contributed to the creation of the video (including presentation), and there appears to be some instances of uneven contributions or challenges in collaboration.

0pts -Only one group member has contributed to the creation of the video, and there appear to be significant disparities in participation or evident challenges in collaboration.
