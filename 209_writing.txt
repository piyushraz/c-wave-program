NAME

		addecho - given an input WAV file, add echo modifications, and
		generate an output WAV file.


SYNOPSIS

		#include <string.h>
		#include <unistd.h>
		#include <stdlib.h>
		#include <stdio.h>


		addecho [OPTION] [OPTION] SOURCE_WAV DEST_WAV


DESCRIPTION

		addecho is a command-line tool for audio manipulation, 
		specifically to apply an echo effect to mono WAV audio files. 
		It is an intuitive way for users to enhance their audio files 
		with added echo effects that can be customized through various
		options. The addecho program adds an echo categorized by delay 
		and volume scale. It takes an input WAV file in binary, 
		applies the added delay and volume scale, and creates a WAV 
		file with echo added. The file is read into an array header 
		and the file size is updated to compile with an echo that is 
		added. Space for the buffer is dynamically allocated and is 
		used to store delay samples of original sounds, modified by 
		volume scale. The input file is processed by mixing samples of
		the original audio with scaled buffered samples and the 
		maximum and minimum range to prevent overflow and underflow of 
		the 16-bit WAV file. The added echo with the original audio is
		placed in an output file.

      	-d, --delay <delay>
			The delay time “-d” in samples before the echo begins.
            Default: 8000.
		
      	-v, --volume <volume_scale>
            Sets volume scale for the echo effect.  “-v < 1” reduces 
			the volume, whereas a “-v > 1” increases echo.
            Default: 4.


RETURN VALUES

      	return 0: Success.
       	return 1: An error occurred.
	

EXAMPLES

       	addecho -d 5000 -v 3 input.wav output.wav
		Applies an echo with a 5000 ms delay and a volume scale of 3 
		to input.wav, saving the result in output.wav.
		
       	addecho input.wav output.wav
		Applies the default echo effect of 8000 ms delay and a volume
		scale of 4 to input.wav and saves the result in output.wav.
		

WARNINGS

       	addecho only supports mono WAV files. Applying addecho to 
		files in other formats may result in unpredictable behavior 
		or data loss. Users should also be cautious with extremely 
		high delay and volume scale values, as these can lead to audio
		distortion.


BUGS

       	- Passing in non-mono wave files.
		- Providing wrong relative path of input WAV file.
		- Passing -d and -v with incorrect values (non-numeric) or 
		  (alphanumeric).
